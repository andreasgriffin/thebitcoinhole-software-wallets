# The Bitcoin Hole - Software Wallets

## Introduction

Software wallets, also known as hot wallets, are applications that enable users to store, manage, and transact with Bitcoin. Unlike hardware wallets, which are physical devices, software wallets are digital and run on various platforms, including desktop, mobile, and web.

This project goal is to have the more complete database of Bitcoin Software Wallets features, so they can be compared, helping users to choose wisely. The database is open-source, meaning anyone can collaborate to improve and correct any wrong data or add new wallets.

## Collaboration

Inside the `items` directory, there is a JSON file for each wallet, with all the data about it. To collaborate (adding missing data, fixing wrong data or adding a new wallet), just fork the repository and send a pull request with the changes.

## Website

The [thebitcoinhole.com](https://thebitcoinhole.com/) website offers a Software Wallet Comparison using this database. This website is the most comprehensive resource for comparing the features of top software wallets. It provides an in-depth analysis of each wallet’s security features, privacy, usability, compatibility, and more.
